JFSD 2022 Web Dev assessment project

**What did you like about this project?**

It was challenging, given the quickness with which we'd been thrown into doing it, but the comprehensiveness made it feel very satisfying to complete. Like, I did it! I built a thing! Not too functional by modern standards, but the important parts of the scripting work!

**What did you struggle with in this project?**

I wasn't exactly able to fully focus on working through the project, thus being very much unable to get it done within the stated 5 hour timeframe. i'm not sure if this was due to how I'd been feeling on the day, or a symptom of undiagnosed ADHD, or if the time limit was intentionally restrictive. I also went about the project in a very meticulous manner, taling the time to think about every single line and every single code fragment I was going to write before writing it, and afterwards tinkering with it in order to get a result that not only fulfilled the technical requirements as stated within the letter of the reference given to us, but also satisified my own requirement that it "look right", conforming to the spirit of said reference. This, of course, added significant time to my completion of the project. There were also a few points where the code was not at all doing what I wanted it to do and was unable to figure out how to make it work; fortunately I have friends within the profession who I am able to ask for help, but it did take me quite a while before I realised that the problem was beyond my powers of search engine manipulation, to speak nothing of my programming ability.

**What would make your experience with this assessment better?**

I'm not too sure, actually. Maybe a bit more clarity on which requirements are set in stone, and which are more open to interpretation? The reference images themeselves are already less than perfect because different people's computers all have different screen resolutions, and having to eyeball a margin because the stated requirements produce a result that looks notably different from the reference image is even trickier through a display with a non-standard resolution, like mine.
